# AGENT SWARM COLLABORATION TEST - LIVE STATUS

## üéØ Test Objective
Multi-agent collaboration to build "Real-time Trading Performance Dashboard Card"

## üìä Agent Workflow Status

### ‚úÖ Stage 1: SOLACE (Director) - COMPLETED
- **Runtime:** 5.3 seconds
- **Action:** Analyzed requirements
- **Decision:** Delegated to ARCHITECT for system design
- **Reasoning:** "Given the requirements for a real-time trading dashboard feature, there is a need for system architecture design and data flow planning"
- **Status:** ‚úì SUCCESS - Proper delegation logic working!

### ‚è≥ Stage 2: ARCHITECT (Designer) - IN PROGRESS  
- **Runtime:** 3+ minutes (198+ seconds)
- **Model:** DeepSeek-R1:14b (8.9GB - largest local model)
- **Action:** Designing system architecture & data flow
- **Status:** üîÑ THINKING (Large model takes time for deep reasoning)
- **Expected:** Will create design document specifying:
  - Component structure
  - API contract (/api/trades/stats)
  - Data flow diagram
  - Real-time update mechanism
  - Responsive design specs

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Stage 3: FORGE (Builder) - WAITING
- **Model:** Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- **Dependency:** Waiting for ARCHITECT's design
- **Action:** Will implement UI component based on ARCHITECT's specs
- **Expected:** Create TradingPerformanceCard.tsx with working code

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Stage 4: SENTINEL (Tester) - WAITING
- **Model:** DeepSeek-R1:8b
- **Dependency:** Waiting for FORGE's implementation
- **Action:** Will validate against ARCHITECT's specs
- **Expected:** Test report confirming functionality

## üß™ What This Tests

‚úÖ **Multi-agent delegation** - SOLACE correctly identified need for ARCHITECT
‚úÖ **Task routing** - Coordinator assigned task to right agent
‚úÖ **Sequential workflow** - Agents waiting for dependencies
‚è≥ **Deep reasoning** - ARCHITECT using large model for complex design
‚è≥ **Knowledge handoff** - Next agent will reference previous work
‚è≥ **Full pipeline** - Design ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Validate

## üìà Performance Metrics

| Agent | Model | Speed | Quality | Status |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| SOLACE | GPT-4 | Fast (5s) | High | ‚úì Complete |
| ARCHITECT | DeepSeek-R1:14b | Slow (3+ min) | Very High | üîÑ Running |
| FORGE | Claude 3.7 | Medium (30s) | High | ‚è∏Ô∏è Waiting |
| SENTINEL | DeepSeek-R1:8b | Fast (10s) | Medium | ‚è∏Ô∏è Waiting |

## üîç Key Observations

1. **SOLACE delegation works perfectly** - Recognized architecture need
2. **ARCHITECT is thorough** - Taking time for quality design (good!)
3. **No stuck loops** - Each agent completing or waiting properly
4. **No SQL errors** - Python task creator working flawlessly
5. **Coordinator stable** - Polling every 5s, no crashes

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Total Time
- SOLACE: 5s ‚úì
- ARCHITECT: ~5-10 min (large model, complex task)
- FORGE: ~30-60s (implementation)
- SENTINEL: ~10-20s (testing)
- **Total:** ~7-12 minutes for full collaboration

## üéØ Success Criteria Progress

- [x] SOLACE delegates appropriately
- [ ] ARCHITECT creates detailed design
- [ ] FORGE implements based on design
- [ ] SENTINEL validates implementation
- [ ] All agents log reasoning to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Multi-agent knowledge sharing demonstrated

**STATUS: 25% Complete - Stage 1 of 4 successful!**
