2025-10-16 17:02:36,150 [INFO] [DELEGATE] SOLACE delegating to ARCHITECT: This task involves a significant amount of planning, refactoring, and design considerations. The ARCHITECT is best suited to audit the files, design the refactoring approach (CSS modules vs styled-components), and plan the implementation. Inline styles need to be replaced with a more scalable solution, such as CSS modules or styled-components, which requires a good understanding of the application's architecture and design. It's also critical to maintain the exact visual appearance while improving code quality and scalability, which falls under the ARCHITECT's expertise.
