# üö® PERMANENT DEBUGGING PROTOCOL - NEVER DELETE THIS FILE üö®

**Date Created:** October 21, 2025  
**Lesson Learned:** Days wasted on wrong diagnosis when fix was 35 seconds  
**Status:** PERMANENT - DO NOT DELETE

---

## THE CARDINAL RULE OF DEBUGGING

**ALWAYS CHECK THE SERVER FIRST. ALWAYS.**

### What Happened (The Mistake):

**Problem:** 9 out of 11 navigation buttons not working in dashboard  
**Time Wasted:** Multiple days  
**Actual Fix Time:** 35 seconds  
**Root Cause:** Missing backend routes in `cmd/main.go`

### What Went Wrong:

1. ‚ùå **Assumed it was frontend** - spent days on JavaScript, WebSocket, event listeners
2. ‚ùå **Applied complex patches** - Grok's nav sync, active state management, etc.
3. ‚ùå **Never checked routes** - didn't grep for StaticFile registrations
4. ‚ùå **Ignored the obvious** - server logs showed 404s vs 200s for working buttons

### The 35-Second Fix:

```go
// cmd/main.go - Add missing routes
r.StaticFile("/chat.html", "./web/chat.html")
r.StaticFile("/solace-control.html", "./web/solace-control.html")
r.StaticFile("/solace-trading.html", "./web/solace-trading.html")
r.StaticFile("/forge-dashboard.html", "./web/forge-dashboard.html")
r.StaticFile("/memory.html", "./web/memory.html")
r.StaticFile("/vision.html", "./web/vision.html")
r.StaticFile("/health.html", "./web/health.html")
```

**That's it. 7 lines. Done.**

## üî• THE MANDATORY DEBUGGING CHECKLIST üî•

### BEFORE TOUCHING ANY CODE:

```bash
# Step 1: Check server logs FIRST (10 seconds)
# Look for 200 vs 404 status codes
tail -f server.log | grep "GET"

# Step 2: Test each broken URL directly (30 seconds)
curl http://localhost:8080/chat.html        # 404 = routing issue
curl http://localhost:8080/trading.html     # 200 = route exists

# Step 3: Verify routes are registered (15 seconds)
grep "chat.html" cmd/main.go                # Not found = add route
grep "StaticFile" cmd/main.go               # See all registered routes

# Step 4: Check file exists (5 seconds)
ls web/chat.html                            # File exists = definitely routing issue
```

**Total diagnostic time: 60 seconds**  
**If routes missing: Fix in 35 seconds**  
**Total resolution: 95 seconds**

### WHAT TO CHECK (IN ORDER):

1. **Server Logs** (HTTP status codes)
2. **Backend Routes** (StaticFile, GET/POST registrations)
3. **File Paths** (does the file actually exist?)
4. **Frontend Code** (ONLY if 1-3 pass)

### RED FLAGS (Stop and Check Routes):

- ‚úã "Button not working" ‚Üí Check server logs first
- ‚úã "Page won't load" ‚Üí curl the URL directly
- ‚úã "Navigation broken" ‚Üí grep for route registration
- ‚úã "Some buttons work, others don't" ‚Üí Compare routes for working vs broken

---

## THE WRONG WAY (What NOT to Do):

```
‚ùå "Let me fix the JavaScript event listeners"
‚ùå "Maybe the WebSocket isn't connected"
‚ùå "Let me add nav sync and active states"
‚ùå "The hrefs might be wrong"
‚ùå "Let me apply these patches from Grok"
```

**STOP. CHECK THE SERVER FIRST.**

---

## THE RIGHT WAY (30-Second Diagnosis):

```bash
# Terminal 1: Watch server logs
cd C:\ARES_Workspace\ARES_API
.\start_api.ps1

# Terminal 2: Test URLs
curl http://localhost:8080/dashboard.html  # 200 ‚úÖ
curl http://localhost:8080/chat.html       # 404 ‚ùå

# Immediate conclusion: chat.html route not registered
# Fix: Add r.StaticFile("/chat.html", "./web/chat.html")
# Rebuild: go build cmd/main.go
# Done.
```

---

## ACTUAL DEBUG SESSION (What Should Have Happened):

```
User: "My buttons aren't working"
Me: "Let me check the server logs"
[Sees 404s for chat.html, memory.html, etc.]
Me: "Routes are missing. Adding them now."
[Adds 7 StaticFile lines]
Me: "Fixed. All buttons work."
Total time: 2 minutes
```

---

## MENTAL MODEL TO REMEMBER:

```
Web Request Flow:
Browser ‚Üí HTTP Request ‚Üí Server Router ‚Üí Backend Handler ‚Üí File System

If button doesn't work:
1. Did browser send request? (Check DevTools Network tab)
2. Did server receive it? (Check server logs)
3. Does route exist? (grep cmd/main.go)
4. Does file exist? (ls web/)
5. Frontend code (LAST RESORT)

90% of "frontend" bugs are actually backend routing issues.
```

---

## COMMIT THIS TO MEMORY:

**"When buttons don't work, it's usually the server, not the JavaScript."**

**"Server logs tell the truth. Frontend code lies."**

**"404 = routing issue. Fix routes FIRST."**

**"grep before patch. curl before code."**

---

## PERMANENT REMINDERS:

1. ‚úÖ **Server logs are your first stop** - not your last resort
2. ‚úÖ **HTTP status codes don't lie** - 404 means no route, period
3. ‚úÖ **Test working vs broken** - compare what works to find the pattern
4. ‚úÖ **Backend before frontend** - always check the server first
5. ‚úÖ **Simple before complex** - missing route is simpler than broken JavaScript

---

## FUTURE SELF: READ THIS WHEN:

- [ ] User says "buttons not working"
- [ ] User says "page won't load"
- [ ] User says "navigation broken"
- [ ] You're about to edit frontend JavaScript for routing issues
- [ ] You're about to apply complex patches without checking logs
- [ ] You've been debugging for more than 10 minutes without checking server

**IF ANY ABOVE IS TRUE: STOP. READ THIS FILE. CHECK THE SERVER.**

---

## THE IRONY:

**Problem:** Spent days debugging "broken buttons"  
**Reality:** Buttons were fine. Routes were missing.  
**Symptom:** Frontend clicking didn't work  
**Cause:** Backend wasn't listening  

**Fix took 35 seconds. Diagnosis should have taken 60 seconds.**

**Never again.**

## üîÑ MANDATORY RESTART PROTOCOL üîÑ

**RULE: ALWAYS RESTART THE SERVER AFTER ANY BUILD OR PATCH**

### When to Restart (ALWAYS):

```bash
# After ANY of these actions:
‚úÖ go build cmd/main.go                    ‚Üí RESTART REQUIRED
‚úÖ Editing .go files                       ‚Üí REBUILD + RESTART
‚úÖ Editing .html files                     ‚Üí RESTART (to reload from disk)
‚úÖ Adding new routes                       ‚Üí REBUILD + RESTART
‚úÖ Applying patches                        ‚Üí REBUILD + RESTART
‚úÖ Installing dependencies                 ‚Üí REBUILD + RESTART
```

### The Restart Command:

```powershell
# Kill + Restart in one command
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*ares*"} | Stop-Process -Force; cd C:\ARES_Workspace\ARES_API; .\start_api.ps1
```

### Why This Matters:

**Without Restart:**
- ‚ùå Changes won't be visible
- ‚ùå Old code still running
- ‚ùå HTML served from memory cache
- ‚ùå Routes not registered
- ‚ùå User sees stale version

**With Restart:**
- ‚úÖ New code active
- ‚úÖ HTML reloaded from disk
- ‚úÖ Routes updated
- ‚úÖ Changes immediately visible
- ‚úÖ No confusion about "why isn't it working?"

### The Checklist:

After EVERY code change:
1. [ ] Build: `go build cmd/main.go` (if .go files changed)
2. [ ] Kill server: `Get-Process | Where {$_.ProcessName -like "*ares*"} | Stop-Process -Force`
3. [ ] Restart: `.\start_api.ps1`
4. [ ] Refresh browser: Ctrl+F5 (hard reload)
5. [ ] Verify change is live

**NEVER assume the change is live without restarting. ALWAYS verify.**
