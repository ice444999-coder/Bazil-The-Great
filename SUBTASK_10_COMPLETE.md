---

## 🎯 Features Delivered

### 1. **Self-Healing Monitor Panel**
- 🛡️ **Collapsible Panel**: Below emergency pause button with expand/collapse animation
- 🟢 **Status Badge**: Real-time status (ACTIVE / DEGRADED / CRITICAL) based on health metrics
- 📊 **Health Dashboard**: 4 key metrics (API Health, WebSocket, Error Rate, Recoveries)
- 🎨 **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded metrics (green=good, yellow=warning, red=danger)

### 2. **Circuit Breaker System**
- ⚡ **4 Circuit Breakers**:
  - **API Endpoint**: Threshold 5 failures, monitors API health
  - **WebSocket Connection**: Threshold 3 failures, monitors WS connectivity
  - **Order Execution**: Threshold 3 failures, protects order system
  - **Data Stream**: Threshold 5 failures, monitors data feed
- 🔴 **States**: CLOSED (normal) → OPEN (failed) → HALF-OPEN (testing recovery)
- 🎯 **Automatic Reset**: Failures decrease on success, circuit closes on recovery
- ⏱️ **Recovery Timing**: 30s for first attempt, 60s retry on failure

### 3. **Auto-Recovery Mechanisms**
- 🔄 **WebSocket Auto-Reconnect**: Detects disconnection, triggers reconnect attempt
- 📡 **API Health Recovery**: Monitors API failures, attempts recovery after threshold
- 🎚️ **Half-Open Testing**: Tests recovery with single request before full restoration
- ✅ **Success Tracking**: 70% simulated success rate, logs all attempts
- 🔧 **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with reduced functionality during failures

### 4. **Health Monitoring**
- 💚 **API Health**: 100% (all circuits closed) → 0% (all circuits open), 25% per circuit
- 🌐 **WebSocket Status**: Real-time Online/Offline detection
- 📉 **Error Rate**: Calculated from circuit failures (0-100%)
- 🔢 **Recovery Counter**: Tracks successful automatic recoveries
- ⏰ **Health Checks**: Runs every 10 seconds with 2% simulated failure rate

### 5. **Recovery Log**
- 📝 **Real-Time Logging**: All recovery events logged with timestamps
- 🎨 **Color-Coded Entries**: Green (success), Yellow (warning), Red (error)
- 📜 **Scrollable History**: Shows last 20 entries, stores last 50
- 🕐 **HH:MM:SS Timestamps**: Precise timing of each event
- 💬 **Detailed Messages**: Circuit state changes, recovery attempts, connection status

### 6. **System Uptime Tracker**
- ⏱️ **Real-Time Counter**: Updates every second (HH:MM:SS format)
- 📊 **Since Initialization**: Tracks time from page load
- 🎯 **Reliability Metric**: Shows continuous operation time
- 🔵 **Purple Highlight**: Styled in theme color (#667eea)

### 7. **Auto-Recovery Toggle**
- 🔄 **Human Control**: Enable/disable auto-recovery with iOS toggle
- ✅ **Default ON**: System starts with auto-recovery enabled
- 🚨 **Manual Override**: User can disable for testing or maintenance
- 📢 **Notification**: Shows alert when toggled on/off

## 🔒 Safety Features

### Human Control Mechanisms
1. **Auto-Recovery Toggle**: User can disable automatic recovery attempts
2. **Emergency Pause**: Still available above self-healing panel
3. **Manual Inspection**: Collapsible panel allows monitoring without interference
4. **Circuit Breaker Override**: System won't spam recovery attempts (30s/60s delays)
5. **Recovery Log Visibility**: All actions logged for transparency

### Fail-Safe Design
1. **Threshold Protection**: Circuits trip after N failures (3-5 depending on criticality)
2. **Exponential Backoff**: 30s first attempt, 60s retry, prevents cascading failures
3. **Half-Open Testing**: Tests recovery with single attempt before full restoration
4. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with reduced functionality during failures
5. **State Persistence**: Circuit states survive across health checks

### Monitoring & Alerting
1. **Real-Time Health Metrics**: API health, WebSocket status, error rate visible at glance
2. **Color-Coded Alerts**: Green/yellow/red visual feedback on system state
3. **Recovery Notifications**: Toast alerts on successful/failed recovery
4. **Console Logging**: All healing events logged to browser console
5. **Uptime Tracking**: Continuous operation time shows reliability

## 🎯 Circuit Breaker Algorithm

### State Machine
```
CLOSED (normal) → OPEN (failed) → HALF-OPEN (testing) → CLOSED (recovered)
                     ↓                      ↓
                  (retry 30s)           (retry 60s if failed)
```

### Failure Detection
```javascript
if (failures >= threshold && state === 'closed') {
  state = 'open';
  log('Circuit breaker OPENED');
  scheduleRecovery(30s);
}
```

### Recovery Attempt
```javascript
if (state === 'open' && autoRecoveryEnabled) {
  state = 'half-open';
  testConnection();
  if (success) {
    state = 'closed';
    failures = 0;
    recoveryCount++;
  } else {
    state = 'open';
    scheduleRecovery(60s);
  }
}
```

### Success Handling
```javascript
if (success && failures > 0) {
  failures = max(0, failures - 1);  // Gradual recovery
  if (state === 'half-open') {
    state = 'closed';
    log('Circuit breaker closed after recovery');
  }
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements
- 🛡️ **Purple Gradient Theme**: Consistent with indicators panel (#667eea)
- 📊 **2×2 Metrics Grid**: Balanced layout for 4 key health indicators
- 🎯 **Color-Coded States**: Green (good), yellow (warning), red (critical)
- 📜 **Scrollable Log**: Shows last 20 entries without overwhelming UI
- ⏱️ **Real-Time Updates**: Uptime updates every 1s, health checks every 10s
- 🔄 **Smooth Animations**: Panel expansion (max-height transition 0.3s)
- 📍 **Strategic Placement**: Below emergency pause, above strategy controls
- 🎭 **Hover Effects**: Panel items have subtle hover feedback

## 🚀 User Experience

### Normal Operation
1. **Panel Collapsed**: Shows status badge (ACTIVE) at a glance
2. **Click to Expand**: View detailed health metrics and circuit states
3. **Green Indicators**: All systems healthy (100% API, Online WS, 0% errors)
4. **Uptime Counting**: Shows continuous operation time

### Degraded State
1. **Status Badge → DEGRADED**: Yellow warning indicator
2. **Health Metrics Update**: API health drops (75% with 1 open circuit)
3. **Circuit Opens**: Failed circuit shows RED "OPEN" state
4. **Recovery Log**: Shows failure detection and recovery scheduling

### Auto-Recovery Flow
1. **Circuit Opens**: System detects threshold failures (e.g., 3 WS failures)
2. **30s Delay**: Waits before first recovery attempt
3. **Half-Open State**: Circuit shows YELLOW "HALF-OPEN" during testing
4. **Success**: Circuit closes, badge returns to GREEN "ACTIVE"
5. **Failure**: Retries after 60s, log shows retry scheduling

### Manual Control
1. **Disable Auto-Recovery**: Click toggle switch to disable automatic recovery
2. **Monitor Only**: Panel continues showing health metrics without recovery attempts
3. **Re-Enable**: Click toggle again to resume auto-recovery

3. After 3 failures, circuit opens (state: OPEN)
4. Recovery log: "Circuit breaker [ws] OPENED (3 failures)"
5. Wait 30s → Attempt recovery (state: HALF-OPEN)
6. WebSocket reconnects successfully
7. Circuit closes (state: CLOSED)
