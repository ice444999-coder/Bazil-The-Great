# 🔧 Health.html Button Fix

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Issue:** Buttons on http://localhost:8080/health.html not working
**Root Cause:** ENDPOINT MISMATCH

---

## 🐛 Problem Found

### health.html was calling WRONG endpoint:
```javascript
// ❌ BROKEN - This endpoint doesn't exist
fetch('/api/v1/monitoring/health', ...)
```

### Actual endpoint in Go API:
```go
// ✅ CORRECT - This is the real endpoint
r.GET("/health/detailed", healthController.GetDetailedHealth)  // Line 300 in v1.go
```

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Changed health.html line 668:
```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN):
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/monitoring/health', {

// NEW (FIXED):
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/health/detailed', {
```

## 📊 Endpoint Mapping

| health.html calls | Go API has | Status |
|-------------------|------------|--------|
| `/api/v1/monitoring/health` | ❌ DOESN'T EXIST | 🔴 BROKEN |
| `/api/v1/health/detailed` | ✅ EXISTS (Line 300) | ✅ FIXED |
| `/api/v1/monitoring/logs` | ✅ EXISTS (Line 664) | ✅ WORKING |

---

## 🧪 Test Now

1. **Start API** (if not running):
   ```powershell
   cd c:\ARES_Workspace\ARES_API
   .\start_api.ps1
   ```

2. **Open health page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/health.html
   ```

3. **Expected result**:
   - ✅ Health data loads
   - ✅ Buttons work
   - ✅ No "404 Not Found" errors in console

---

## 🔍 How This Was Missed

The health.html file was calling `/api/v1/monitoring/health` but the Go API routes show:

```go
// Line 299-301 in v1.go
r.GET("/health", healthController.GetHealth)
r.GET("/health/detailed", healthController.GetDetailedHealth)  
r.GET("/health/services", healthController.GetServiceRegistry)

// Line 664 in v1.go  
monitoring.GET("/logs", monitoringController.GetLogs)
```

The `/monitoring` group has `/logs` but NOT `/health`.
