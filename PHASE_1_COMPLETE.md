# 🎉 Phase 1 Complete: Sandbox Trading Infrastructure

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-11
**Total Time:** Autonomous overnight build
**Commit:** `b861aca`

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### Backend API (Go 1.25.1)

#### Database Schema
Created migration `004_autonomous_trading_system.sql` with 5 tables:
- **sandbox_trades**: Stores every trade with reasoning, P&L, market conditions
- **trading_performance**: Win rate, Sharpe ratio, Kelly Criterion, VaR
- **market_data_cache**: OHLCV + technical indicators
- **strategy_mutations**: Tracks strategy evolution for recursive learning
- **risk_events**: Kill-switch activation logs

#### Repository Layer
- `TradingRepository`: 17 methods for CRUD operations
- Enhanced `BalanceRepository` with auto top-up methods

#### Service Layer
- `TradingService`: Core trading logic
  - ExecuteTrade(): Uses real CoinGecko prices, calculates fees (0.1%)
  - CloseTrade(): P&L calculation `(exit - entry) * size / entry - fees`
  - CloseAllTrades(): Emergency kill-switch
  - checkAutoTopup(): Automatic balance refill

#### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/v1/trading/execute       - Execute sandbox trade
POST /api/v1/trading/close         - Close open position
POST /api/v1/trading/close-all     - Kill-switch (close all)
GET  /api/v1/trading/history       - Trade history (paginated)
GET  /api/v1/trading/open          - Get all open positions
GET  /api/v1/trading/performance   - Performance metrics
```

#### SOLACE Integration
- Added `execute_trade` tool to Claude API tool definitions
- Tool parameters: `trading_pair`, `direction`, `size_usd`, `reasoning`
- Wired `TradingService` into `ClaudeService` via dependency injection
- Updated system prompt with trading instructions

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Interaction Flow

1. **User**: "SOLACE, can you please go to your sandbox trading tab and start learning how to trade?"

2. **SOLACE** (via Claude API): "I'm accessing the sandbox trading environment now. Current balance: $10,000. Let me analyze the market conditions..."

3. **SOLACE calls tool**:
   ```json
   {
     "tool": "execute_trade",
     "trading_pair": "BTC/USDC",
     "direction": "BUY",
     "size_usd": 500.00,
     "reasoning": "BTC showing upward momentum on 20-day SMA, RSI at 52 (neutral). Small position to test execution."
   }
   ```

4. **Backend**:
   - Fetches real BTC price from CoinGecko ($43,250)
   - Validates balance ($10,000 available)
   - Calculates fees (0.1% = $0.50)
   - Deducts $500.50 from balance
   - Creates trade record with SHA256 hash
   - Stores in `sandbox_trades` table

5. **SOLACE receives confirmation**:
   ```
   ✅ SANDBOX TRADE EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY

   Trade ID: #1
   Trading Pair: BTC/USDC
   Direction: BUY
   Entry Price: $43,250.00
   Position Size: $500.00 USD
   Fees: $0.50
   Status: OPEN

   Reasoning: BTC showing upward momentum...
   Trade hash: a3f5b2c8d1e4f6a7...
   ```

6. **Later, SOLACE can close the trade**:
   - Fetches current price ($44,000)
   - Calculates P&L: `($44,000 - $43,250) / $43,250 * $500 - $0.50 = $8.16`
   - Returns $500 + $8.16 = $508.16 to balance
   - Updates `realized_pnl` field

## 📊 System Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Starting Balance | $10,000 USD (virtual) |
| Fees | 0.1% per trade |
| Auto Top-up (optional) | Threshold: $1,000, Amount: $10,000 |
| Market Data | CoinGecko API (real-time) |
| Trading Pairs | BTC/USDC, ETH/USDC, SOL/USDC |

---

## 🧠 Recursive Learning Architecture

Every trade SOLACE makes is stored with:
- **Reasoning**: Why the trade was made
- **Market Conditions**: Price, volume, 24h change at trade time
- **Outcome**: P&L, P&L %
- **Trade Hash**: SHA256 for lineage tracking

This creates a **memory trail** that SOLACE can:
1. Recall when making future decisions
2. Analyze to identify patterns (what worked, what didn't)
3. Use to mutate strategies over time

---

## 🔐 Safety Features

✅ **Sandbox Only**: No real money, no wallet keys
✅ **Kill-Switch**: Close all positions in emergency
✅ **Audit Trail**: Every trade hashed and logged
✅ **Auto Top-up**: Optional, user-controlled
✅ **Balance Validation**: Can't trade more than available

---

## 🚀 What's Next (Phase 2)

### Desktop UI (C# Avalonia)
1. **Sandbox Trading Tab**
   - Current balance display
   - Open positions table
   - Trade history with filters
   - Performance dashboard (charts, win rate, P&L)

2. **Balance Settings**
   - Auto top-up checkbox
   - Threshold/amount configuration

3. **Live Trading Tab** (Jupiter stub for future)

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Test Steps
1. Start API: `./ares_api.exe`
2. Chat with SOLACE via `/api/v1/claude/chat`
3. Say: "Execute a sandbox trade on BTC/USDC, buy $100 worth"
4. SOLACE should call `execute_trade` tool
5. Check database: `SELECT * FROM sandbox_trades;`
6. Verify balance was deducted

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Context Management**: Successfully built across multiple context windows by:
   - Committing code frequently
   - Maintaining detailed status documents
   - Reading docs on session restart

2. **Autonomous Execution**: User requested "no interruptions for permission" - delivered continuous build overnight

3. **Circular Dependency Resolution**: Used setter injection (`SetTradingService`) to wire `TradingService` into `ClaudeService` after initialization

4. **Interface Consistency**: Had to rename `GetUSDBalance` to `GetUSDBalanceModel` to avoid method signature conflicts

---

## 🏆 Success Criteria

✅ API compiles without errors
✅ SOLACE has access to `execute_trade` tool
✅ Tool is properly wired to `TradingService`
✅ System prompt updated with trading instructions
✅ Database schema created and ready
✅ All endpoints implemented
✅ Code committed to Git
✅ Documentation complete
